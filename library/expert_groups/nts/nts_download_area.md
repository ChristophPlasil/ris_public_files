#### NtS Encoding Guide

The NtS Encoding Guide explains the applicability of the four NtS Message types as well as codes to be used in case of certain events. It provides NtS editors with NtS Message filling instructions, thus allows nationally and internationally harmonised encoding of NtS Messages.
Considering increased use of the NtS Web Service, NtS Messages shall be further harmonised to ensure proper display of content on third party systems. Uniform encoding of messages is also a prerequisite for consideration of messages in voyage planning applications.
The NtS Encoding Guide version 1.0 applies to NtS XSD 4.0 and the NtS Web Service WSDL 2.0.4.0. Two documents are available.

#### NtS Encoding Guide for editors :

The NtS Encoding Guide for editors is intended for personnel editing (and publishing) NtS Messages including step-by-step creation instructions for the proper message types including specific examples as well as explanation of codes.

#### NtS Encoding Guide for application developers :

The NtS Encoding Guide for developers includes guidelines for NtS application implementation, explaining logic, processes and auto/default values.

#### Implementation status :
 
In the NtS Expert Group an evaluation of the implementation status of NtS in Europe as well as the implementation status of the RIS Index is carried out annually:

*   [National NtS Service](docs/File/427/nts_implementation_status_2017_11_24.xlsx) (covered corridors, version of NtS std., implemented msgs., way of distribution),
*   [RIS Index](docs/File/427/ris_index_implementation_status_2018_06_06.xlsx) (used versionavailabilitydate of publication etc.),
*   [NtS deeplink table](docs/File/427/nts_deeplink_verification_state_2017_11_24.xlsx) (register including direct links to RIS Services in European countries),
*   [NtS Web Service and interconnections](/docs/File/427/nts_interconnection_matrix_and_ws_parameters_2018_06_06.xlsx) (which system \[vertical axis\] is requesting information from which data source \[horizontal axis\]), including : 
	-	i. Spreadsheet “WSDL 1.0.3.0” includes Web Service interconnections in line with NtS XSD 3.0
	-	ii. Spreadsheet “WSDL 2.0.4.0” includes Web Service interconnections in line with NtS XSD 4.0

#### Reference data

The Notices to Skippers (NtS) standard facilitates
*   automatic translation of the most important content of notices,
*   a harmonized structure of data-sets to facilitate the integration of notices in voyage-planning systems.

To provide automatic translation of content NtS Reference Tables are used including translations of NtS code values to 24 languages.
The NtS Reference Tables are maintained by the NtS Expert Group and are part of the published technical specifications.  
  
The NtS Reference Tables are available for [download](docs/File/425/2019_02_22_nts_tables_4_0_xsd4_0_.xlsx)
