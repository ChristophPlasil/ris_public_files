# Implementation status
 
In the NtS Expert Group an evaluation of the implementation status of NtS in Europe as well as the implementation status of the RIS Index is carried out annually:

*   [National NtS Service](docs/File/427/nts_implementation_status_2017_11_24.xlsx) (covered corridors, version of NtS std., implemented msgs., way of distribution),
*   [RIS Index](docs/File/427/ris_index_implementation_status_2018_06_06.xlsx) (used versionavailabilitydate of publication etc.),
*   [NtS deeplink table](docs/File/427/nts_deeplink_verification_state_2017_11_24.xlsx) (register including direct links to RIS Services in European countries),
*   [NtS Web Service and interconnections](/docs/File/427/nts_interconnection_matrix_and_ws_parameters_2018_06_06.xlsx) (which system \[vertical axis\] is requesting information from which data source \[horizontal axis\]), including : 
	-	i. Spreadsheet “WSDL 1.0.3.0” includes Web Service interconnections in line with NtS XSD 3.0
	-	ii. Spreadsheet “WSDL 2.0.4.0” includes Web Service interconnections in line with NtS XSD 4.0
	-	iii. Spreadsheet “WS parameter OPERATIVE systems” includes the parameters of the operational national NtS data sources
	-	iv. Spreadsheet “WS parameters TEST systems” includes the parameters of the national NtS test systems
