# Reference data

The Notices to Skippers (NtS) standard facilitates
*   automatic translation of the most important content of notices,
*   a harmonized structure of data-sets to facilitate the integration of notices in voyage-planning systems.

To provide automatic translation of content NtS Reference Tables are used including translations of NtS code values to 24 languages.
The NtS Reference Tables are maintained by the NtS Expert Group and are part of the published technical specifications.  
  
The NtS Reference Tables are available for [download](docs/File/425/2019_02_22_nts_tables_4_0_xsd4_0_.xlsx)
