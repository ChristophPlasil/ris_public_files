The Expert Group on Notices to Skippers (NtS Expert Group)

The Expert Group Notices to Skippers Expert (NtS) is an international platform that ensures a harmonized development of the Notices to Skippers standard in the different international organisations. The NtS Expert Group adapts the technical specifications for Notices to Skippers to technical developments and users requirements. The NtS Expert Group submits new versions of the NtS standard to the European Commission, the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine, the Danube Commission, the Mosel Commission, the Sava Commission, the UN/ECE and other interested international organisations for formalisation.


The international standard for Notices to Skippers provides a standardized data format, which can be used for publishing notices to skippers on the internet (pull-services) or for distribution by e-mail (push services).
