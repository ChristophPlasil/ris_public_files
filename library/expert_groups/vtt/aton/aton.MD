# AtoN
  
Inland AIS is a communication system based on maritime AIS to automatically provide positionidentity and other navigation data of a ship and to exchange safety related information between ships and between ship and shore.

Following the existing maritime applicationsInland AIS can also be used to provide information for emphasizing classical aids to navigation for the marking of buoys.

A dedicated AIS Aids to Navigation Report message (AIS AtoN) transfers the position and the meaning of the aids to navigation as well as information if the buoy is on the required position or not (off-position). Inland AIS makes use of this AIS AtoN message but introduces an additional coding of inland specific Aids to Navigationfollowing CEVNI.

This Inland AIS AtoN report message can either be transmitted by a specific Inland AIS AtoN station mounted on a buoyor by an AIS shore station.

Using the Inland AIS AtoN report message allows for informing about a real buoy lying in the water or for informing about a position where no real buoy is presenta so-called virtual AtoN respectively

Ships equipped with an appropriate display system like Inland ECDIScan display the information contained in the Inland AIS AtoN report messagee.g. as a symbol on the chart at the reported position of the AtoN. This functionality still needs to be standardised further and is not yet implemented in all Inland ECDIS applications.
