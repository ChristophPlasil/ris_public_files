# ASM

Inland AIS can do more than just providing identity and the position of a vessel. Inland AIS can also be used for the exchange other navigation and voyage related information between vessels and between vessel and shore beyond what is implemented in the Inland AIS station.

Inland AIS allows the transfer of Application Specific Messages (ASM) via the AIS radio link (AIS VDL) as a means of communication for external applications. The use of Inland ASM is a kind of data exchange between externally connected users of two or more Inland AIS stations with connected external application. The data content does not affect the operation of the Inland AIS stations

An appropriate way for the display of ASM content on board is through a connected Inland ECDIS display. The shore system also needs to support the transmission and handling of these messages and provide means for input and output of the related information.

Examples for this kind of information which can be provided by Inland AIS are ETA/RTAactual water levelor signal status at a lock or bridge and bridge height. The commonality of this information is the relevance for the tactical navigation and the timeliness in which the information should be provided to the skipper.

The mechanism within Inland AIS for the transfer of this information is the so called Application Specific Message (ASM).
