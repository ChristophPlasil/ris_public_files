##### Reference data relative to ASM

Inland AIS can do more than just providing identity and the position of a vessel. Inland AIS can also be used for the exchange other navigation and voyage related information between vessels and between vessel and shore beyond what is implemented in the Inland AIS station.

Inland AIS allows the transfer of Application Specific Messages (ASM) via the AIS radio link (AIS VDL) as a means of communication for external applications. The use of Inland ASM is a kind of data exchange between externally connected users of two or more Inland AIS stations with connected external application. The data content does not affect the operation of the Inland AIS stations

An appropriate way for the display of ASM content on board is through a connected Inland ECDIS display. The shore system also needs to support the transmission and handling of these messages and provide means for input and output of the related information.

Examples for this kind of information which can be provided by Inland AIS are ETA/RTAactual water levelor signal status at a lock or bridge and bridge height. The commonality of this information is the relevance for the tactical navigation and the timeliness in which the information should be provided to the skipper.

The mechanism within Inland AIS for the transfer of this information is the so called Application Specific Message (ASM).

##### Reference data relative to AtoN
  
Inland AIS is a communication system based on maritime AIS to automatically provide positionidentity and other navigation data of a ship and to exchange safety related information between ships and between ship and shore.

Following the existing maritime applicationsInland AIS can also be used to provide information for emphasizing classical aids to navigation for the marking of buoys.

A dedicated AIS Aids to Navigation Report message (AIS AtoN) transfers the position and the meaning of the aids to navigation as well as information if the buoy is on the required position or not (off-position). Inland AIS makes use of this AIS AtoN message but introduces an additional coding of inland specific Aids to Navigationfollowing CEVNI.

This Inland AIS AtoN report message can either be transmitted by a specific Inland AIS AtoN station mounted on a buoyor by an AIS shore station.

Using the Inland AIS AtoN report message allows for informing about a real buoy lying in the water or for informing about a position where no real buoy is presenta so-called virtual AtoN respectively

Ships equipped with an appropriate display system like Inland ECDIScan display the information contained in the Inland AIS AtoN report messagee.g. as a symbol on the chart at the reported position of the AtoN. This functionality still needs to be standardised further and is not yet implemented in all Inland ECDIS applications.
