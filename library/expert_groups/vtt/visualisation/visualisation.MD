# Visualisation
The current edition 2.3 of the Inland ECDIS standard defines the colours and symbols to be used for the visualisation of received AIS targets and the time out values of the target information. The requirements are partially deviating from Inland ECDIS in information mode to Inland ECDIS in navigation mode.

Other data like (Inland) ship static and voyage related data as well as certain dynamic data items, received application specific messages and the display and input of own ship data are not yet covered by the Inland ECDIS standard.

This documents on the visualisation of AIS related information shall provide guidelines for the visualisation of those data in order to support safe and easy usage of Inland AIS data in Inland ECDIS displays on board a vessel. The documents complement the existing Inland ECDIS and VTT Standards, however they have only recommendatory character.

The present documents constitute the current state of the discussion. As new developments and further experience will be made the documents might be further matured in future editions.
