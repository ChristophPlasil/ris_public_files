<strong>The EU Directive 2006/87/ECthe Rhine Shipping Examination Regulations (RheinSchUO) and EC Regulation 164/2010 establish the minimum set of hull data to be exchanged among vessel certification authorities and RIS Authorities. The European Hull Database (EHDB) facilitates this data exchange. <br/>
The information is needed for:<br/><ul>
<li>Vessel certification authorities - to avoid assigning more than one European Vessel Identification Numbers (ENIs) for one vessel</li>
<li>RIS Authorities - for several RIS applications such as keeping lock diaries and preparing lock statistics</li>
</ul>
Directive 2013/49/EU requires the national authorities to update the datasets at a regular basis.<br type="_moz"/><br/></strong>
