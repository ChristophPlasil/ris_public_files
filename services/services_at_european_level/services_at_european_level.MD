*   [__European Hull Database__](http://www.ris.eu/services/european_hull_data_base__ehdb_):&nbsp;Certain inland waterways vessels require a technical inspection before being allowed to sail on European inland waterways. Vessel certification authorities issue community certificates after technical inspections. A subset of the data of community certificates, the so-called minimum set of hull data, includes the ‘Unique European Vessel Identification Number’, the name of vessel, length, breadth. According to Directive 2013/49/EU, the minimum set of hull data needs to be exchanged among vessel certification authorities and with RIS authorities. PLATINA facilitated the implementation of the European Hull Database, which eases this data exchange. More than 13.800 vessels are available in the database, which represents around 80% of the European Fleet. The European Commission has taken over the operation of the European Hull Database in March 2016. Directive 2013/49/EU requires the national authorities to update the datasets at a regular basis. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contact point for technical questions: [MOVE-EHDB@ec.europa.eu](javascript:location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(77,79,86,69,45,69,72,68,66,64,101,99,46,101,117,114,111,112,97,46,101,117)+'?')

*   [__European Reference Data Management System (ERDMS)__](http://www.ris.eu/services/european_reference_data_management_system__erdms_): Reference Data are used by various RIS applications. They include data on the inland waterway network infrastructure, for instance the location of locks, bridges and ports. The ISRS location codes are the unique identifiers of these objects and allow the connection of information from various River Information Services, e.g. the static data of a bridge provided by an Inland ENC and the reduced vertical clearance of that bridge during maintenance works that is provided by Notices to Skippers. These data is provided by national authorities. Skippers consult these data through various RIS applications, therefore, this data needs to be consolidated and maintained in a structure manner, in order to facilitate the usage of consistent&nbsp;data in diverse onboard applications. In cooperation with national authorities, PLATINA defined data management procedures and implemented a reference management tool. This facilitates the harmonised generation of reference data. Application manufacturers and RIS users can download this data at one central point. The European Commission is operating the RIS data reference management system since 2016. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contact point for technical questions:&nbsp;[MOVE-ERDMS@ec.europa.eu](http://MOVE-ERDMS@ec.europa.eu)

*   [__Maintenance of Inland ENC (Electronic Navigational Charts) Register and the digital parts of the Inland ENC standard__](http://www.ris.eu/services/maintenance_of_inland_enc__electronic_navigational_charts__register_and_the_digital_parts_of_the_inland_enc_standard): The digital part of the Inland ECDIS Standard is based on the S-57 Standard of the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO) and comprises a machine readable Object Catalogue and a Presentation Library with Lookup Tables and a Symbol Library. IHO however is in the process to move to a next gen-eration of the standard, which will be based on S-100, the Universal Hydrographic Data Model. The S-100 provides the basis for the use of Inland ENCs in maritime applications. The S-100 Registry includes the Inland ENC Register. The operation of the Inland ENC register and the maintenance of the digital parts of the Inland ECDIS Standard is financed by the European Commission.
*   [__RIS portal__](http://ris.eu): A benchmark and inventory to determine the best approach for a one-stop RIS portal was undertaken in cooperation with the RIS Expert Groups, also taking national activities into account. Technical specifications for the RIS portal were approved by the Expert Groups in April 2009. Based on these technical specifications the web application – RIS portal (www.ris.eu) – was built and was successfully launched during the RIS Expert Groups meetings in November 2009 in Vienna. At present, the RIS Portal operating &nbsp;is financed by the European Commission.
