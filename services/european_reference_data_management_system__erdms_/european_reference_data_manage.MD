__Reference data are used by various RIS applications. They include data on the inland waterway network infrastructurefor instance the location of locksbridges and ports. These data are provided by national authorities. Skippers consult these data through various RIS applications; thereforethe data needs to be consolidated and maintained in a structured mannerin order to facilitate the usage of consistent data in diverse onboard applications.

*   RIS index: data related to infrastructure (RIS objects) on inland waterways (such as junctionslocksbridgesberthsgauges etc).
*   ADN codes: as specified in 2008/68/EC
*   HS codes: harmonised system codes from the customs organisation (non-dangerous goods)
*   ERI Locations: (also known as SRS codes) as used in ERI (electronic reporting) using the ERINOT message. At the moment the SRS codes overlap with the RIS indexbut this ERI location set also includes all the international locations outside of Europe
*   Container types: to identify the type of container (ISO 6364)
*   Country codes: the several country codes for all the countries (ISO 3166)
*   Inner package type: (UN Rec 21)
*   Ship type: to describe the type of transport (UN Rec 28)
*   Notices to Skippers codes
