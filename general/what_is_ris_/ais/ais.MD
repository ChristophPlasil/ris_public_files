__AIS stands for Automatic Identification System. It is an identification system that automatically transmits information about the name, position, speed and course of a ship. (_more information under this text).&nbsp;_If a ship is equipped with AIS, data is automatically sent to shore-based installations called AIS base stations.Through AIS you can even automatically exchange data with other vessels in the vicinity AIS has been in use for a long time in maritime shipping. To better respond to the specific needs of inland shipping, an Inland AIS has been developed._ ___

The AIS is also able to receive the same sort of information from other vessels. AIS was in the first place a ship- to-ship communication device to display position course over ground and its use was in the first place for collision avoidance. The structure of the messages and the way it was broadcast gave rise to the use of an AIS device on shore where an observer could observe the movements of the vessels in range. This principle is taken by authorities to observe the vessel traffic. Special devices were developed that could not only observe the traffic but also affect the traffic or relate to one vessel in the traffic. This device developed to the so-called base station. In order to obtain a surveillance larger stretches of water than the range of one base station were developed into networks. Apart from the normal messages that are sent at (different) time periods, special message were developed, the so-called binary messages.
