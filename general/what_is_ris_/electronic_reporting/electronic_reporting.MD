__The objective of the electronic reporting standard for inland shipping navigation is:


*   To facilitate Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between parties in inland shipping and parties in intermodal transportation which are involved in inland shipping
*   To avoid having to report voyage data more than once to the various authorities and/or commercial parties
*   To provide rules and standards for the exchange of electronic messages between parties in inland shipping. Public authorities and other stakeholders (ship ownersskipperscharterersterminalsports) must ensure that their data complies with these data exchange standards and rules.Electronic reporting software (BICS)&nbsp;
