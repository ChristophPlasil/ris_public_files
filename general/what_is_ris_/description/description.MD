# Description

<strong>River Information Services (RIS) are information services designed to enhance safety and efficiency of inland waterway transport (IWT) by optimising traffic and transport processes. Focal aspect is a swift demand oriented electronic data transfer between water and shore through real-time exchange of information. RIS therefore aim to streamline the exchange of information between all IWT stakeholders. Since 2005an <a href="/library/legislation">EU framework directive</a>&nbsp;provides minimum requirements for RIS implementation and agreed RIS standards to enable cross-border compatibility of national systems. The European waterways affected by the RIS Directive are illustrated in the following picture:</strong>

__Policy perspective__  
  
# Legal and common framework
  
[EU framework directive (EC/2005/44)](/library/legislation)  
  
# RIS objective

*   Enhancement of safety in inland ports and rivers.
*   Enhance the efficiency of inland navigation - optimise the resource management of the waterborne transport chain by enabling information exchange between vesselslock and bridgesterminals and ports.
*   Better and more effective use of the inland waterway infrastructure - providing information on the status of fairways.
*   Environmental protection - providing traffic and transport information for an efficient calamity abatement process.
*   Better integration of IWT into multimodal supply chains trough accurate and timely information to support transport management.

# Services

*   Information on fairways to plan execute and monitor voyages by boat masters and fleet managers (e.g.water levelsaids to navigation fairway information opening hours of locks etc). The information comprise geographical hydro-meteo and traffic related data;
*   Traffic information services comprise information on vessel positions to allow for tactical or strategic planning;
*   Traffic management aims at optimising the use of the infrastructure as well as facilitating safe navigationespecially at VTS Centersas well as at locks and bridges;
*   Calamity abatement services are responsible for registering vessels and their transport data at the beginning of a trip and updating the data during the voyage with the help of a ship reporting system. In case of an accidentthe responsible authorities are capable of providing the data immediately to the rescue and emergency teams;
*   Information for transport management includes estimated times of arrival (ETA's) provided by boat masters and fleet managers based on fairway information making it possible to plan resources for port and terminal processes. Information on cargo and fleet management basically comprises two types of information: information on the vessels and the fleet and detailed information on the cargo transported;
*   Statistics and customs services: the RIS improves and facilitates the collection of inland waterway statistical data in the Member States;
*   Waterway charges and port dues: the travel data of the ship can be used to automatically calculate the charge and initiate the invoicing procedure.

# Operational perspective
  
*   Traffic-related information benefits all parties when it comes to safety.
*   Transport-related informationwhich focuses mainly on efficiency.
