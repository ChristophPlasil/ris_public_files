# History

04/2016: The PIANC INCOM Working Group 125 started with the update of the PIANC RIS Guidelines, taking the new Corridor Management approach for RIS in due consideration. The publication of the new PIANC RIS Guidelines 2018 is expected for mid-2018.

03/2016: The European Hull Database (EHDB) and the European Reference Data Management System (ERDMS) have been transferred into permanent IT operation under the auspices of the European Commission.

12/2015: The European Commission initiated a study on the Digital Waterway Area (DINA) and the Digital Multimodal Nodes (DMN) as part of its Digital Single Market Strategy. Results of the study are expected for mid-2017.

12/2015: The multinational TEN-T Project “RIS Enabled European Inland Waterborne Transport Corridor Management” presented its results and laid the foundation of a new approach for the provision of River Information Services within navigation corridors.

01/2015: The European Commission initiated a revision of all four Commission Regulations concerning the RIS key-technologies Electronic Reporting, Inland ECDIS, Notices to Skippers and Vessel Tracking and Tracing. The publication of the revised Commission (Implementing) Regulations is expected for 2017.

07/2014: The study on the “Evaluation of RIS Implementation for the period 2006-2011”, conducted by the European Commission, has been finalised and published [http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/inland/studies/inland_waterways_en]

01/2014: The TEN-T Regulation entered into force on 1.1.2014 and introduced in particular a new double-layer structure distinguishing between a core network and a comprehensive network. The TEN-T Regulation reinforces the requirements of the RIS Directive. The financial envelope provided for TEN-T for 2014-2020 (“Connecting Europe Facility”) exceeds 26 billion Euros and provides co-financing of River Information Services.

09/2013: The European Commission published the technical specifications for Inland Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (Inland ECDIS).

09/2013: The European Commission adopted the NAIADES II package "Towards quality inland waterway transport".

03/2012: PIANC published an update of the RIS Guidelines.

03/2011: The European Commission White Paper “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area" - highlights the importance of having integrated multimodal travel services across the EU. Innovation in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) through initiatives such as a directive on the deployment of ITS as well as an action plan containing specific targets are mentioned. The importance of developing RIS, also in combination with maritime transport (eMaritime/Bleu Belt) is mentioned.

2010: The European Commission published the technical specifications for Electronic Reporting.

2007: The European Commission published the technical specifications for Notices to Skippers as well as for Vessel Tracking and Tracing Systems.

2006: The European Commission adopts the RIS guidelines, in order to ensure the interoperability of the RIS services. The development of RIS is also recognized and fostered by various River Commissions.

2005: The European Council and Parliament adopt the RIS Framework Directive of the European Union (2005/44/EC),

2004: The PIANC RIS Guidelines 2002 are updated and adopted by the Central Commission for the Navigation on the Rhine in (March).

2002: The International Association for Navigation (PIANC) establishes RIS Guidelines

2001: EC White Paper “Transport Policy for 2010: time to decide”, supports the development of RIS.
The Declaration of European Ministers of Transport (CEMT), September Rotterdam calls for the implementation of a pan-European River Information Services by the year 2005.

1998: The European Union officially defines the concept of River Information Services (RIS) to improve the reliability and availability of inland navigation.

1990 onwards: In the late 1990s, several countries worked on information systems for inland shipping. As their work was not very coordinated, continuation could have led to the implementation of different technologies in each country. European research, particularly that funded through EU research programmes, has played a very important role in harmonising the development of RIS. The policy development went hand in hand with European research. Research, demonstration and implementation activities have contributed to technology, organisation and policy, and have helped to clear the obstacles to effective realisation of River Information Services. European research projects like INCARNATION, INDRIS, COMPRIS and ALSO Danube, develop the RIS concept. The first steps towards harmonization of processes and definition of RIS standards are taken.
