__Information exchange is considered a key enabler for the increased use of inland waterway transport. During the past decade the European CommissionMember States and infrastructure operators worked together to definebuild and deploy River Information Services (RIS) to facilitate navigation and information exchange between transport operators and infrastructure managers.  

Currently a new approach is envisaged to interconnect information on infrastructurepeoplevesselsmanagementoperations and cargo. The approach consists of two interlinked concepts: ‘Digital Inland Waterway Area’ (DINA) and ‘Digital Multimodal Nodes’ (DMN). DINA and DMN shall build on the achievements of River Information Services and related developments in other modes of transport. It will be used as input for the upcoming revision of the RIS-directive.
