Inland ECDIS is a system for the display of electronic inland navigation charts and additional information. Its purpose is to contribute to safety and efficiency of inland navigation and thus also to protection of the environment. Simultaneously Inland ECDIS is to reduce the workload when navigating the ship as compared to traditional navigation and information methods. Inland ECDIS provides also the basis for other River Information Services (RIS)e.g. Inland AIS.
