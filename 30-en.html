						<h4>River Information Services</h4>

						<p><a href="http://www.ris.eu/expert_groups/introduction" style="text-transform:lowercase;">Introduction</a></p>-->
						<p>River information services (RIS) is the concept for information services in inland navigation to support traffic and transport management in inland navigation, including interfaces with other modes of transport. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32005L0044&qid=1570197771023&from=EN">Directive 2005/44/EC</a> on harmonised river information services on the EU’s inland waterways (hereinafter referred to as the RIS Directive) requires Members States to implement RIS and, when doing so, according to certain standards. The RIS are expected to improve safety, efficiency and the environmental friendliness of inland navigation. The EU has taken a global approach that encompasses policy development, a legal framework, support for research and development and monitoring of implementation of the legislation.</p>
						<p>The RIS Directive refers to the four different key technologies: the Inland Electronic Chart Display and Information System (Inland ECDIS), Notices to Skippers (NtS), Inland (AIS) and Electronic Reporting International (ERI). These technologies are based on technical and operational standards which were initially defined and are continuously updated by the RIS Expert Groups. The RIS Directive demands Member States to implement RIS according to these standards. A major contribution to the standardisation process has been the European Commission’s adoption through technical regulations of standards for Inland ECDIS , Notices to Skippers  (NtS), Vessel Tracking and Tracing  (VTT) and Electronic Reporting International  (ERI). The European Commission is currently reviewing the RIS Standards.</p>
						<p>The RIS Directive was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 7 September 2005 and is almost 15 years old. DG MOVE has started an evaluation in January 2019 of whether the RIS Directive has achieved its objectives. On the basis of this evaluation it will decide whether an impact assessment should be carried out with a view to a possible revision of the Directive. The results of the evaluation of the RIS Directive are foreseen for the end of 2019 or at the latest for the 1st semester 2020 and could lead to the possible full revision of the RIS Directive.</p>
						<p>In the current concept of RIS, the four standards are designed in silos, largely independent of each other. In the future, the possible revision of the RIS Directive and the increasing importance of transversal themes contained in CESNI/TI’s work programme could likely justify merging the work for the four RIS Expert Groups.</p>
						<p>The RIS Standards were originally elaborated according to a technical and operational approach and they now need to evolve to a more RIS-user centered approach.</p>
						</br>
						<p>On 8 November 2018, CESNI adopted <a href="https://www.cesni.eu/a-propos/programme-de-travail/">its work programme 2019-2021</a>, including the part on information technologies and revised its priority system (I, II, III and Permanent) . The implementation of CESNI work programme is also supported by a multiannual financial framework for the same period.</p>
						
						<!--<h4>Legal and common framework</h4>
  
						<p>EU framework directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1415888490219&amp;uri=CELEX:32005L0044">EC/2005/44</a>)</p> in text-->
  
						<h4>RIS objectives</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Enhancement of safety in inland ports and rivers.</p></li>
							<li><p>Enhance the efficiency of inland navigation - optimise the resource management of the waterborne transport chain by enabling information exchange between vesselslock and bridgesterminals and ports.</p></li>
							<li><p>Better and more effective use of the inland waterway infrastructure - providing information on the status of fairways.</p></li>
							<li><p>Environmental protection - providing traffic and transport information for an efficient calamity abatement process.</p></li>
							<li><p>Better integration of IWT into multimodal supply chains trough accurate and timely information to support transport management.</p></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Services</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Information on fairways to plan execute and monitor voyages by boat masters and fleet managers (e.g.water levelsaids to navigationfairway informationopening hours of locks etc). The information comprise geographical, hydrological, meteorological and traffic related data;</p></li>
							<li><p>Traffic information services comprise information on vessel positions to allow for tactical or strategic planning;</p></li>
							<li><p>Traffic management aims at optimising the use of the infrastructure as well as facilitating safe navigation especially at RIS Centers as well as at locks and bridges;</p></li>
							<li><p>Calamity abatement services (CAS) are responsible for registering vessels and their transport data at the beginning of a trip and updating the data during the voyage with the help of a ship reporting system. In case of an accident the responsible authorities are capable of providing the data immediately to the rescue and emergency teams;</p></li>
							<li><p>Information for transport management includes estimated times of arrival (ETA's) provided by boat masters and fleet managers based on fairway information making it possible to plan resources for port and terminal processes. Information on cargo and fleet management basically comprises two types of information: information on the vessels and the fleet and detailed information on the cargo transported;</p></li>
							<li><p>Statistics and customs services: the RIS improves and facilitates the collection of inland waterway statistical data in the Member States;</p></li>
							<li><p>Waterway charges and port dues: the travel data of the ship can be used to automatically calculate the charge and initiate the invoicing procedure.</p></li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Operational perspective</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Traffic-related information benefits all parties when it comes to safety.</p></li>
							<li><p>Transport-related information which focuses mainly on efficiency.</p></li>
						</ul>
